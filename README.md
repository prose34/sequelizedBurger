# Eat the Burger App! Sequelize Version

Created during Week 15 of the SMU Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a burger logger with Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The MVC design pattern was followed; using Node and Sequelize to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
