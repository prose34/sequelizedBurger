# Eat the Burger App!

Created during Week 14 of the SMU Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The MVC design pattern was followed; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
